The BOLD, Barcode of Life, pipeline of the Reference Sequence Browser (RSB) is designed to screen the BOLD database for genetic barcode coverage using a list of scientific names provided by the user. Once inputted, the application will conduct a search on the most up to date version of the BOLD database using the BOLD Systems API Package for R.

The tool allows users to manipulate the results gathered by prompting the user to filter results by country of origin and by giving the option to remove entries also present in NCBI. All subsequent tables and visualizations are based on this filtering, which can be changed by returning to the appropriate tabs at any time.

Like the other database pipelines, the app produces a CM where the organism names are rows, gene names are columns, and each intersection of a row and column shows how many records are in the BOLD database. The app also creates a statistical summary of the CM and users may download the associated FASTA files. Afterwards, a variety of tables and graphs are presented to help users analyze the data and fine-tune their filters.
