The 'CRUX Coverage Matrix' returns a value that represents how many reference sequences exist for the user's organism search terms in each public database. The rows of the table produced are the organism search terms, and the columns are CRUX databases: `16S`, `Vertebrate`, `12S`, `18S`, `Plant`, `ITS1`, `CO1`, `Fungal`, `ITS2`, and `trnL`.

The cells will show one of the following:

1. The number of sequences in a database, if direct matches are found.
2. If no direct matches are found, the next most specific taxonomic rank found.
3. `0` if nothing is found at any taxonomic rank.
4. `Error` if while searching there was an issue while running the search
