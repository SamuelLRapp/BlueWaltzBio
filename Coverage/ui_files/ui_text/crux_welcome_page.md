The CRUX pipeline of RSB takes in a list of organism(s) and searches through the seven publicly available CALeDNA CRUX Metabarcoding databases to find how many records match the search. The RSB searches through a copy of these databases that are updated periodically. The last update was in October 2019.

When direct matches are not found in a database, the tool will then search for higher taxonomic ranks (genus, family, order, class, phylum, domain), via the R package "Taxize", until a match is found. For example, if the Giant Seastar (`Pisaster giganteus`) isn't found in the `COI` database, the app will search for the presence of the genus `Pisaster`, and then family `Asteriidae`, and so forth.

Users are given the choice to use the package "Taxize" to append synonyms and correct spelling mistakes of organism names. The tool then showcases a Coverage Matrix (CM), showing the reference sequence abundance or taxonomic resolution for each marker/gene per organism, and a statistical summary of the CM.
