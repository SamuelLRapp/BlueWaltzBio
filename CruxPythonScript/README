Packages need to run this script:

Package         Version
--------------- -------
numpy           1.22.0
pandas          1.3.5
pip             21.1.2
python-dateutil 2.8.2
pytz            2021.3
setuptools      57.0.0
six             1.16.0
wheel           0.36.2

Before running this script you will need the following files:

    1. For any barcode you want to verify you will need its corresponding CSV file (You can create this file using the R script that is in this folder)
    2. You also need a taxonomy file
    3. and a file contained the CRUX results that our tool generated

Once installed to run simply execute the script with:

    - python3 dataVerification.py

After it has executed it should have created 2 files:

    1. The logger file to help debug if necessary
    2. The CSV with the result verification (this file will contain an ERROR column which will let you know if there have been any ERRORS)
